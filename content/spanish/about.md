Welcome to my blog! It will cover a wide range of different topics around programming, Linux, hosting and similar. Off topic and such will be covered a bit as well, but programming will be the main focus of this Blog. 

# About the author
I’m Damon, some might know me as Stax. I’m a beginning C++ programmer and a big Linux and opensource enthusiast. On this blog, I want to document and share my experiences and knowledge in all kinds of topics I’m interested in. Most posts will be bilingual in both German and English. The information will always be the same, so just read in the language you prefer! 

# Articles at dev.to
Most of the English Articles can also be found and read on dev.to [(here)](https://dev.to/mcwertgaming). I’m publishing those articles there as well, because it’s really the best way to share my posts with more people. Dev.to is at the same time a really awesome community centric project I want to contribute to.
